# Exercise 4: Add code to the above program to figure out who has the most
# messages in the file.
# After all the data has been read and the dictionary has been created, look through
# the dictionary using a maximum loop (see Section [maximumloop]) to find who
# has the most messages and print how many messages the person has.
# Enter a file name: mbox-short.txt
# cwen@iupui.edu 5
# Enter a file name: mbox.txt
# zqian@umich.edu 195
